### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended)

1. **Open GitHub Codespace** file explorer (left sidebar)
2. **Navigate to** `docs/presentation/` folder
3. **Drag your PDF file** from `/home/emil/Caine-Live/Neuer Ordner/ASI-Core_Presentation.pdf` directly into the folder

3. **Choose** your PDF file from local system

cp "/home/emil/Caine-Live/Neuer Ordner/ASI-Core_Presentation.pdf" \
   "/workspaces/asi-core/docs/presentation/ASI-Core_Presentation.pdf"
```

## Verification

After upload, verify the PDF:

```bash
